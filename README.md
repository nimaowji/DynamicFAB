# DynamicFAB
This is a Floating Action Button in Android. FABs positions are generally based on language direction. For example, in English, it's on the right side. This FAB will change its position based on the user's hand! If the user is holding his phone with his right hand, it's on the right side but if the user holds his phone with his left hand, it will go to the left side! **Please follow me on Twitter: [@nima_owji](https://twitter.com/nima_owji).**
